                With a proven track record in customer support, technical support, and leadership , my desire to learn and passion for creativity has led me to this new adventure. 
                After heavy deliberation I decided to leave my amazing job in Operations Management at a stellar fintech startup. 
                I am pursuing a degree in Front End Development and Web Design, with an additional education in photography. 

                <br>
                <br>
                I have always been an outside the box thinker and problem solver at heart. 
                In the past you could often find me in a support role, because I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of the job. 
                With the new knowledge I have gained in these degrees, I get to combine my passion for probelm solving with my desire to create, and I couldn't be happier. 
                <br>
                <br>
                You can currently find me working in my home office surrounded by my spouse, teenager, and two dogs, volunteering for the Performing Arts Committy as their Web Devolper and Tech Support Chair, or at one of the many Minneapolis parks honing in on my photography skills.
                <br>
                <br>
                Whether it is to help you build your website, take senior portraits, or just say hi, I hope to hear from you.
